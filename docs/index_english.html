    <h2>Presentation</h2>
    <br>

    <p>
      Designed as a prestigious international hotel complex, the Hôtel de la Paix occupies a strategic position on the seafront,
      in a privileged location in the capital. The building is 7 storeys high on a first floor, and comprises mainly
      two V-shaped wings, offering the vast majority of the 216 rooms a direct view of the sea. In addition, a
      16 pavilions, each housing two suites, have been built in a landscaped park to the west of the main building.
      an entertainment area with a swimming pool between the building and the pavilion park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Construction of the hotel began in August 1972 and was completed in September 1974, with the inauguration taking place on
      January 9, 1975. Unfortunately, since 2005, the hotel has remained abandon. By March 2023, there was talk of demolishing
      the building. In order to safeguard its heritage, <a href="https://www.mitsiomotu.com/" class="custom-link"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitsio Motu</a> proposed to map the site using two methods.
    </p>

    <h2>3D Cartography</h2>
    <br>

    <p>
      In order to preserve the architectural heritage of this building and highlight its specificity, which is representative of its
      era, Mitsio Motu's team undertook a mission to acquire images by drone in order to reconstruct the building as a 3D model.
    </p>
    <p>
      This involved planning drone flights to operate in the field. Some 2,200 images were taken of the site. These images
      were used to generate a 3D model of the building. The video below shows the result of the acquisition and reconstruction
      and reconstruction.

    <h2>Architectural models</h2>
    <br>

    <p>
      In parallel with the 3D reconstruction, a team of architects and urban planners mapped the site in order to classify
      and appreciate the different types of buildings present in the area. The image above shows an axonometric view of the Hôtel de
      la Paix site. Axonometry is a graphic representation method widely used in architecture to present a project in three dimensions.
      It enables a building or space to be represented with realistic proportions and spatial relationships, while providing an overall
      vision of the structure.

      Information sheets have been drawn up for each type of building, indicating the materials used in its construction and
      its architectural features.

      3D mapping was proposed and implemented by <a href="https://github.com/apluquet" class = "custom-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adèle Pluquet</a> et
      <a href="https://linktr.ee/adrien.ludwig" class = "custom-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adrien Ludwig</a> as part of their collaboration
      with Mitsio Motu in 2023.
    </p>
    <p>
      The axonometries and descriptions of the architecture of the hotel and its surroundings were produced by a team of urban planners and
      architects including All-Glory Houenassou, Isreal Obi, Abiel-Verén Fidegnon and Steven Montcho, with the support of architect-urbanist
      Monica Coralli.
